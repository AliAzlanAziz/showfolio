# showfolio

## to: anyone who is reading especially @farza and the buildspace team
building this project for the buildspace sage s5 nights and weekends

### Week#01 Idea+Description
one liner: mobile app to make portfolio 

description: 
- building the app as there are no portfolio apps currently (just 2 are there i.e. behance and efolio). i feel there is a gap that i can bridge. 
- though ofcourse my plan for coming 5 weeks is just to get the portfolio maker app up and running but i do plan to expand it further even after the sage s5.
- one would be able to create his/her portfolio and search and view others.

these are the apis, will link the frontend soon

### Week#02 Toy

- i have made almost all the restful apis by now in nodejs typescript. (this is the api repo)
- i have to implement two things now, one is ml/ai model to rate the portfolios of users.
- other is to make ui of the mobile app and integrate it with the apis. 
- i plan to develop it in the next 2 weeks. 

#### Toy 
toy is this api + screenshot of the app below (still under progress)
