# showfolio

to: anyone who is reading especially @farza and the buildspace team

building this project for the buildspace sage s5 nights and weekends

one liner: mobile app to make portfolio 

description: 
- building the app as there are no portfolio apps currently (just 2 are there i.e. behance and efolio). i feel there is a gap that i can bridge. 
- though ofcourse my plan for coming 5 weeks is just to get the portfolio maker app up and running but i do plan to expand it further even after the sage s5.
- one would be able to create his/her portfolio and search and view others.

these are the apis, will link the frontend soon
